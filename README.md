# NHA-2018Spring

This repository includes my code for the NHA JS.01 class.

## WEEK 1 notes

### Challenge 1: Structuring my files

* My HTML, CSS and JavaScript code need to be in different files.
* I need to include my CSS file in my HTML one in the `<head>` element

``` html
<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/script.js"></script>
```

* In end to include my JS file in my HTML one at the end of the `<body>` element

``` html
<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/script.js"></script>
```

### Challenge 2: Github repository - my first pull request

* Create a new branch from Github Desktop
* Updated my README file with some notes from challenge 1, and save/commit it with a good commit note.
* Test my code. (fixed it because it didn't work and I forgot to put something into my HTML file!)
* Added some more notes here about the steps that I took for challenge 2.
* committed my code in Github desktop (with a good commit note!)
* Publish the branch.
* Create a pull request (click on the button) - Add a description - and send it.
* Look at the pull request on the web github.com

### Challenge 3: Markdown, HTML & CSS basics

* I've used several markdown formatting features in this file.
* Indentation is important
* Comments are done differently in every language!

### Challenge 4: Reading documentation

* Example code is helpful to get some ideas, and to play with the code to see what it does.
* Reference documentation is useful for learning everything that a function or feature can do.
